- run `nvm use 16.15.1` to use the right node version
- run `cd web && npm install` to enable code completion support and local development
- make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed
- run `./dev.bat` for Windows or `./dev.sh` for Linux and the API should be exposed on localhost:3000
